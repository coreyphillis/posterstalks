<p class="binderItem"><strong>How R fits in</strong><br/>R is great because it is,<br/>
* Open source. Anyone can contribute code that is avaiable for anyone else to run freely. There is no issue with people requiring expesive proporietary software.<br/>
* If a set of scripts become useful as a package, then it can easily be made available during development to anyone else while in progress (using devtools). But once it is complete, has been tested, and has received adequate feedback, it can then be shared with everyone else.<br/>

In an effort to make these tools in R a bit more formal, two colleagues (Carl, Scott) and I began an organization called RopenSci. Short for R open science. Our aim is to build tools we might use to support our own academic interests (i.e. Gain access to biological data and also literature, embed these in reproducible code, and make the entire process transparent from start to finish).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Caveats: <br/>
A) we do realize that this level of openness isn’t something that most academics could go given in...</p>

Ecology, and various other journals in my field have begun requiring their authors to deposit data into this repository. We provide programmatic access to these data via R. <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>DataONE</strong><br/>DataONE is a large consortium grant aimed at building the infrastructure needed to maintain and share environmental data. Any organziation can apply to become a member node. So as data are generated, they can be pushed into a member node, get a DOI, and then become available to anyone with rights to such data. By default, the user is the only one who can access it. But over time time, this can be extended to the lab group, the organization, and everyone.<br/>

What is Open Science?<br/>
Data and literature should be open<br/>
People who collect data from publicly funded research are obligated to make these available in the future, especially once they have acheived their objective.<br/>
<br/>
R is great because it is free, the tools can be developed by anyone. And R does a great job talking to APIs. RESTful interface.<br/>
