## The plan

+ Pose the problem: jif doesn't capture article level impact.  Jif not open., easily gamed, single entity controlling
+ the solution: altmetrics, open versions, transparent, diverse impacts, 
+ relation to open access: see ross' paper, can give OA journals some visibility in absence of impact factor
+ really not being used for hiring decisions now, but possibly soon? It seems inevitable
+ details: what do they look like? How are they collected.  
+ wrap up

## There are a lot of papers out there

<br><br><br>

<font size="14"><center> How do we sort them out, the good from the bad </center></font>

---

## We rank journals using the JIF
<br>
<center>![](assets/img/jif.png)</center>

---

## Then we judge papers, journals, scholars, departments, schools on journal IF's
<br>

<br><br><br>

<font size="14"><center> Problems </center></font>

--- 

## JIF is not open
<center>![](assets/img/lock.png)</center>

--- 

## JIF is controlled by single for-profit entity w/o transparency
<br>
<center>![](assets/img/jif.png)</center>

--- 

## Measured at the journal level
<br>
<center>![](assets/img/journallevel_1.jpg)</center>

---

## Articles within journals vary in impact

## ImpactStory just got NSF grant to track software reuse/impact

## <font color="black">Altmetrics measure diverse impacts</font>
<br>
* <font color="blue">Usage</font>: html, xml, pdf downloads
<br><br><br>
* <font color="orange">Citations</font>: Scopus, PubMed Central, Crossref
<br><br><br>
* <font color="green">Social media</font>: Twitter, Mendeley, Facebook, etc.

## Which...

* Serve 
	* Universities: Plum Analytics
	* Publishers: Altmetric.com, ImpactStory
	* Individuals: ImpactStory
	* Readers: PLOS ALM
* Vary in openness 
	* Open data: PLOS\*\*, Plum Analytics\*\*
	* Some open data: Altmetric.com
	* Open data, but API deprecated: ImpactStory

<font size="14"><center> What does this have to do with OA? </center></font>

<!-- relation to open access: see ross' paper, can give OA journals some visibility in absence of impact factor -->

--- 

## Many OA journals don't select for impact

Altmetrics can help filter articles *after* publication

*screenshot of two different papers w/ very different altmetrics data*

---

## Filtering is a key thing altmetrics can do

* But largely unrealized
* Though some promising work from researchers

<screenshot from jevin west's work>

* And at least one app: NAME?

---

<br><br><br>

<font size="14"><center> What do these altmetrics look like? And where do they come from? </center></font>

<!-- details: what do they look like? How are they collected. -->

---

## Usage

* html, xml, pdf downloads, collected by publishers





```r
# Plot data from html, xml, and pdf across papers, all within same plot if
# possible
```


---

## Citation

* Scopus, PubMed Central, Crossref


```r
# Plot data from html, xml, and pdf across papers, all within same plot if
# possible
```


---

## Social media

* Twitter, Mendeley, Facebook, etc., collected by altmetrics aggregators


```r
# Plot data from html, xml, and pdf across papers, all within same plot if
# possible
```


--- 

<br><br><br>

<font size="14"><center> How are altmetrics being used? </center></font>

<!-- really not being used for hiring decisions now, but possibly soon? It seems inevitable. being
used for filtering what papers to read
used for ????
-->

---

## Plum Analytics 

* Institutional subscribers w/ altmetrics dashboards for their faculty/staff
* Don't know if they evaluate them on these though?

<center><img src="assets/img/plum_dashboard.png"></center>

---

## ImpactStory

* Pushing their profiles as the new CV

<center><img src="assets/img/impactstory_profile.png"></center>

---

## Altmetric.com

* Publishers using to display metrics

<center><img src="assets/img/altmetric_eg.png"></center>

---

* Anecdotes that academics reporting altmetrics on their CV's and say that it *may* have helped them get tenure

---

## Things to worry about

* Data consistency: aggregators don't collect data in the same way, e.g., Twitter => ImpactStory (Topsy), Altmetric (Twitter API), PlumAnalytics (Topsy), PLOS ALM (??)
* Data provenance: aggregators tracking this, but newcomers may not - some provenance we'll never know
* Long-term sustainability: Web resources are ephemeral - how do we ensure data persistence?
* Openness: 
	* open data
	* transparent calculations
