## The plan

+ Pose the problem: jif doesn't capture article level impact.  Jif not open., easily gamed, single entity controlling
+ the solution: altmetrics, open versions, transparent, diverse impacts, 
+ relation to open access: see ross' paper, can give OA journals some visibility in absence of impact factor
+ really not being used for hiring decisions now, but possibly soon? It seems inevitable
+ details: what do they look like? How are they collected.  
+ wrap up

## There are a lot of papers out there
<br>

---

## How do we sort them out, the good from the bad

---

## We rank journals using the JIF
<br>
<center>![](assets/img/jif.png)</center>

---

## Then judge papers and scholars on a journal's IF

<font size="14"><center> Problems </center></font>

--- 

## JIF is not open
<br>
<center>![](assets/img/closed_lock.png)</center>

--- 

## JIF is controlled by single for-profit entity w/o transparency
<br>
<center>![](assets/img/money.png)</center>

--- 

## Measured at the journal level

## Which have...

* ...all open data (PLOS, ImpactStory), or
* ...some open data (Altmetric)

In stark contrast to the JIF
