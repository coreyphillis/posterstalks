## Bugs can get fixed quickly

---

## Can get lots of users potentially

### Which means

+ find bugs faster
+ user community start to help each other (see [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/))
+ additional functionality added - crowdsourcing ideas

---

## Companies are supporting open source (most major programming languages)

## Use open source software

+ Likely made by other academics

---

+ Be a good citizen

---

+ Report bugs

---

+ Do your homework before asking questions

---

+ It's almost always better than closed software

---
 
## Making open source software

+ Version control 
+ Collaboration
+ Documentation
+ Development framework
+ Testing

---

## R 

+ Version control: ideally [git](http://git-scm.com/)
+ Collaboration: [Github](https://github.com/)
+ Documentation: [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html)
+ Development framework: [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)
+ Testing: [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat)

---

## Python

+ Just ask Ethan :)

---

## Getting credit for software development

+ There currently are very few incentives for software dev
+ Papers give credit, but not best way to talk about software
+ Shouldn't we get credit for the software itself - not papers about the software?
+ NSF starting to recognize other products in academia, including data, physical collections, curriculum material and **SOFTWARE**!!! See [here](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#dmp)

---

## Licenses 

+ Creative Commons, MIT, etc
+ Use permissive licenses
+ GitHub has help for you on this at [http://choosealicense.com/](http://choosealicense.com/)
